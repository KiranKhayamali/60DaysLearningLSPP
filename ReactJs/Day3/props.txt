Props
- props get passed to the component
- function parameters
- props are immutable
- Usage :
	- props -> functional components
	- this.props -> class components



State
- state is managed within the component
- variables declared in the function body
- state can be changed
- Usage:
	- useState Hook -> functional components
	- this.state -> class components

setState
- Always make use of setState and never modify the state directly
- Code has to be executed after the state has been updated?
	- Place that code in the call back function which is the second argument to the setState method.
- When you have to update state based on the previous state value, pass in a function as argument instead of the regular object
